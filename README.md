# Seat-Assigner
In this project, I wanted to read an Excel file in Java just for fun. I ended up writing a program that assigns students random seat numbers. The program needs an Excel file to read the students names located at the first 2 columns. It then writes the students' names and their seating numbers to a .txt output file.
